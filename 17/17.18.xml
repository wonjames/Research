The two main methods for computing basic hypergeometric functions are: (1) numerical summation of the defining series given in §§17.4(i) and 17.4(ii); (2) modular transformations.
</sentence>

<sentence sentence-num-in-para="2" sentence-num-in-section="3" xml:id="C17.S18.p2.s2">
Method (1) is applicable within the circles of convergence of the defining series, although it is often cumbersome owing to slowness of convergence and/or severe cancellation.
</sentence>

<sentence sentence-num-in-para="3" sentence-num-in-section="4" xml:id="C17.S18.p2.s3">
Method (2) is very powerful when applicable (Andrews (1976, Chapter 5)); however, it is applicable only rarely.
</sentence>
