Applications of Struve functions occur in water-wave and surface-wave problems (Hirata (1975) and Ahmadi and Widnall (1985)), unsteady aerodynamics (Shaw (1985) and Wehausen and Laitone (1960)), distribution of fluid pressure over a vibrating disk (McLachlan (1934)), resistive MHD instability theory (Paris and Sy (1983)), and optical diffraction (Levine and Schwinger (1948)).

<sentence sentence-num-in-para="2" sentence-num-in-section="2" xml:id="C11.S12.p1.s2">
More recently Struve functions have appeared in many particle quantum dynamical studies of spin decoherence (Shao and HÃ¤nggi (1998)) and nanotubes (Pedersen (2003)).
